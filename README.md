# µRings SE (uRings, microRings) Eurorack [Rev D]

## 8HP Eurorack module | Resonator

[μRings SE](http://urings-se.com) is a resonator, transforming unpitched external excitation signals into pitched sounds by modeling the vibrations of bars, tubes, and strings.

This re-engineered Eurorack module updates and simplifies the classic [Mutable Instruments Rings](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/rings/) design by miniaturizing the module from 14HP to 8HP and redesigning the front panel layout without eliminating any original functionality.

Fully compatible with upstream Rings firmware. Includes power cable, mounting hardware, and a one-year warranty. Designed and built with care by [Tall Dog Electronics](http://tall-dog.com) in Western Massachusetts. Licensed [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) open source hardware.
